## PWA Implementation Details

### Service Worker Strategy

- **Cache First**: Static assets (images, fonts, CSS, JS)
- **Network First**: API calls with fallback to cache
- **Stale While Revalidate**: Dynamic content with background updates

### Caching Strategy

- **Static Assets**: Cached for 1 year (fonts, images, icons)
- **API Data**: Cached for 1 day with network-first approach
- **App Shell**: Cached for instant loading
- **Runtime Caching**: Intelligent caching based on content type

### Offline Features

- **Offline Fallback Page**: Helpful message when content unavailable
- **Cached Content Access**: All cached content available offline
- **Connectivity Detection**: Real-time online/offline status
- **Graceful Degradation**: App works with limited connectivity

### Installation Features

- **Install Prompt**: Automatic installation suggestion
- **App Shortcuts**: Quick access to key sections
- **Splash Screen**: Native app-like loading experience
- **Standalone Mode**: Full-screen app experience

## GitHub Integration Details

### API Endpoints Used

- `GET /users/arjun-computer-geek/repos` - Fetch all repositories
- `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/topics` - Fetch repository topics

### Experience Calculation

Experience is automatically calculated from September 1, 2023 to the current date, providing accurate year/month breakdown.

### Data Caching

- Repository data: 5 minutes stale time, 30 minutes cache
- Experience calculation: 1 hour stale time, 24 hours cache
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### Error Handling

- Graceful fallbacks for API failures
- Loading states for better UX
- Error boundaries for component-level error handling
